when you complete a branch log, make a folder with the name of the next version. move the branchlog into it.

  now, when once you merge the branches, you know when it was added.


  so, lets aay you are working on version 1.9.3, with a beanch named "bob", while working on "bob", you have "bob.txt" in the first folder. once done, you move it to "completed/1.9.3". if 3 branches are completed before that update, they all go ijto that folder.
  this allows you to later on see "well, bob was part of 1.9.3"
