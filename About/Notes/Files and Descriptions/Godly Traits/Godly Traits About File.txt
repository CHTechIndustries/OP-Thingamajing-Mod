		=DISCLAIMER=
This Mod was made just for me, but I Uploaded it in Case anyone would be Interested in a Generic OP Trait Mod. 
I am not Responsible for any Corruptions or Broken things. 
Use at your own Risk 
(Its my First Mod and it should work but still use Caution, dont wanna Bork your Game up)
		=DISCLAIMER=
		
		
Adds Multiple Basically OP Traits. 
They are so Rare that they have to be 
given Manually via Debug or other Mods 
that can give/take Traits.
		
There are 3 "Levels" of Intensity of the Strenght: 
Master, Demigod and God.
		
		
Master: 
A Trait that enhances a Pawn far beyond 
their Limits. Still in the Reigns of 
"Normal Playtrough" even if 
deemed Cheating
		
		
Demigod: 
4x~ as Strong as Master, 
making them Overpowered
		
		
God: 
100x~ Stronger - 
Basically just Cheating.
		
		
		
		
Additionally Adds 2 "Compilation" Traits:
		
		
Protagonist:
Typical Isekai Anime Protagonist 
sent into this World trough 
a Car Accident. 
(Adjusted to be Extremely Strong, 
but not Unkillable Overpowered OP)
		
		
Deity:
Basically all God Traits combined 
(Peak - You are basically Godmode) 
(... Yet when a Ceiling of a 
Cave Crushes you, it still means 
Instant death for whatever reason)
		
Additionally Adds 2 Cursed and 1 Accursed Trait 
(Cursed = 1 OP Strenght BUT Strong Weakness)
(Accursed = This Pawn is meant to suffer.)
		
		
		
	I hope you found what you searched for 
	and have fun with it!
