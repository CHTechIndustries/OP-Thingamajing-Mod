Version: 1.2


=DISCLAIMER=
This Mod was made just for me, but I Uploaded it in Case anyone would be Interested in a Generic OP Trait Mod.
I am not Responsible for any Corruptions or Broken things.
Use at your own Risk
(Its my First Mod and it should work but still use Caution, dont wanna Bork your Game up)
=DISCLAIMER=


Adds Multiple Basically OP Traits.
They are so Rare that they have to be
given Manually via Debug or other Mods
that can give/take Traits.

Theres 3 "Severity's" of the Trait
Master - Way stronger than normal Traits but still within Reasoning.. in a way
Demigod - 4x~ Stronger than Master - Powerfull
God - 100x~ Stronger than Demigod - basically OP


> Use Prepare Carefully or Character Editor
to give your Pawns these Traits
(This is a Recommendation, not a need)
(I am not affiliated with them but their Mods are very nice and Powerfull - Check them out)
