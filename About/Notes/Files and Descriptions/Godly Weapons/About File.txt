the Balance and Immersion of the Game.

>This Mod includes Weapons that can
easily destroy your Entire Base.

>This Mod uses alot of Effects/Entities/Projectiles.
It could be that your game could Lag upon increased use.

If you see Enemies having these Weapons,
this is not intended.
Its recommended to Remove the Mod
if enemies Spawn with these Weapons
(Since obviously you
dont want OP Enemies.. i guess?)
