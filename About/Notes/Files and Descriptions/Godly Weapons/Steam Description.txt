________________Godly Weapons________________

A Simple Mod that adds some OP Weapons.
It adds a Research Tab named "Godly" where you can Research the Weapons and then Craft them on a Crafting Spot.
it is Very Expensive to Research, but because these Weapons are OP I thought it could "balance" it at least a bit. If you want to skip this Step just enable Debug and Skip the Research.

Additions of this Mod

Weapons added (6)

- Branch of Love


- Lesser Bow of Death


- Masterfull Dagger of Death


- Pellets of Flora


- Erasure


- Extinction




Hediffs Added (Health Problems) (9)
- Lovestruck
(Initially Planned to be given when hit by the Branch of Love but i couldnt figure out how to give a Hediff by a Projectile Hit, therefore the Branch of Love has been adjusted to be different than what i had in mind)


- Deity


- Cursed - Immobile, Incapable, Meltingflesh, Senseless


- Light Cursed - Incapable, Mobility


- Accursed




(NOTICE: Hediffs can only be given via Debug)
(You can play around with them or simply give "Deity" to your Protagonist)


Hediffs were a thought of mine to be added via Various weapons and Items, but i got too motivated with the Idea Phase and couldnt do it in the Scripting phase, but i still wanted to add them because of reasons.
They are not given by any Weapon or Trigger, so they are only used for Playtroughs that have intentions on "Roleplaying" or such
(maybe in the Future ill get behind it again and try to make it work)
