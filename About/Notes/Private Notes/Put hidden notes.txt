this is for notes that the public does not need to see, such as notes to self (like "remember, I used "such and such" as a preset. Or "I left this semi-unfinished, remember to look at it"). Only people on github will see this (mod publisher plus is set up to not upload this folder)

Also contains the folder for typeing drafts of steam descriptions and FAQ discussions, for backing it up in case they get reverted
